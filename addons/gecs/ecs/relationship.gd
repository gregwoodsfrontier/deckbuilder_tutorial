## Relationship
## Represents a relationship between entities in the ECS framework.
## A relationship consists of a [Component] relation and a target, which can be an [Entity], a [Component], or an archetype.
##
## Relationships are used to link entities together, allowing for complex queries and interactions.
## They enable entities to have dynamic associations that can be queried and manipulated at runtime.
## The powerful relationship system supports component-based targets for hierarchical type systems.
##
## [b]Relationship Types:[/b]
## [br]• [b]Entity Relationships:[/b] Link entities to other entities
## [br]• [b]Component Relationships:[/b] Link entities to component instances for type hierarchies
## [br]• [b]Archetype Relationships:[/b] Link entities to component/entity classes
##
## [b]Query Features:[/b]
## [br]• [b]Type Matching:[/b] Find entities by relationship component type (default)
## [br]• [b]Query Matching:[/b] Use dictionaries to match by specific property criteria
## [br]• [b]Wildcard Queries:[/b] Use [code]null[/code] targets to find any relationship of a type
##
## [b]Basic Entity Relationship Example:[/b]
## [codeblock]
##     # Create a 'likes' relationship where e_bob likes e_alice
##     var likes_relationship = Relationship.new(C_Likes.new(), e_alice)
##     e_bob.add_relationship(likes_relationship)
##
##     # Check if e_bob has a 'likes' relationship with e_alice
##     if e_bob.has_relationship(Relationship.new(C_Likes.new(), e_alice)):
##         print("Bob likes Alice!")
## [/codeblock]
##
## [b]Component-Based Relationship Example:[/b]
## [codeblock]
##     # Create a damage type hierarchy using components as targets
##     var fire_damage = C_FireDamage.new(50)
##     var poison_damage = C_PoisonDamage.new(25)
##     
##     # Entity has different types of damage
##     entity.add_relationship(Relationship.new(C_Damaged.new(), fire_damage))
##     entity.add_relationship(Relationship.new(C_Damaged.new(), poison_damage))
##     
##     # Query for entities with any damage type (wildcard)
##     var damaged_entities = ECS.world.query.with_relationship([
##         Relationship.new(C_Damaged.new(), null)
##     ]).execute()
##     
##     # Query for entities with fire damage amount >= 50 using component query
##     var fire_damaged = ECS.world.query.with_relationship([
##         Relationship.new(C_Damaged.new(), {C_FireDamage: {'amount': {"_gte": 50}}})
##     ]).execute()
##
##     # Check if entity has any fire damage (type matching)
##     var has_fire_damage = entity.has_relationship(
##         Relationship.new(C_Damaged.new(), C_FireDamage.new())
##     )
## [/codeblock]
##
## [b]Component Query Examples:[/b]
## [codeblock]
##     # Query relation by property value
##     var entities = ECS.world.query.with_relationship([
##         Relationship.new({C_Eats: {'value': {"_eq": 8}}}, e_apple)
##     ]).execute()
##
##     # Query target by property value
##     var entities = ECS.world.query.with_relationship([
##         Relationship.new(C_Damage.new(), {C_Health: {'amount': {"_gte": 50}}})
##     ]).execute()
##
##     # Query both relation AND target
##     var entities = ECS.world.query.with_relationship([
##         Relationship.new(
##             {C_Buff: {'duration': {"_gt": 10}}},
##             {C_Player: {'level': {"_gte": 5}}}
##         )
##     ]).execute()
